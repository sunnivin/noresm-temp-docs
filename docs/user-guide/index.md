# User guide

This is the user guide for running single-site simulations with the [NorESM LandSites Platform](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/). It guides you through [installing the software](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/user_guide/#0-prerequisites-first-time-setup) and how to [use the Graphical User Interface (GUI)](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/user_guide/#2-inside-gui-set-simulation-settings) and the [analysis tools in JupyterLab](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/user_guide/#4-look-at-your-output). More information about the LSP and the model framework is available in our [technical documentation](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/documentation/). If you want to learn more about the FATES, CLM, and NorESM models, we have collected some useful links to tutorials and documentation in the [external resources page](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/resources/).

!!! warning 

    Note that the default values and input data we provide are sufficient for educational uses, but should not be considered high-quality model experiments. If your goal is to set up high-quality model experiments, you might want to modify or provide your own input data, set up long spin-up simulations to reach a steady-state, and think about model calibration and validation. While the LSP makes it easier to model, you the user are responsible for following good ethical and scientific practices according to your purposes. Note also that we (the LSP development team) are not responsible for the models themselves, and that data downloaded from external sources may have terms and conditions of use. Make sure to read and follow the terms and properly credit the relevant models, software, and data if you plan to publish your model experiment!
